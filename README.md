# 🧩 About Me:

I’ve been working on fraud detection systems, exploring how rule-based validation, geolocation checks, and machine learning models can work together to identify suspicious transactions. That experience sparked my interest in building reliable, scalable backend systems.

Right now, I’m diving deeper into Java Spring for backend development, experimenting with Rust to understand low-level performance and safety, and exploring the broader world of distributed systems. My focus is on learning how to design systems that are both efficient and resilient.

Outside of coding, I like running it keeps me disciplined and clears my head. My long-term goal is to become a well rounded backend engineer who can contribute to impactful and technically challenging projects.
